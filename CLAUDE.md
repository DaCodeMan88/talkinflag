## Active Roadmap

**✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-11 (`32b5a5f` on main, deploying to talkinflag.com): Instagram image share + eval archetype share card** — plan at `docs/plans/2026-07-11-instagram-image-share-and-eval-share-card.md`. All 6 tasks done, verified (tsc/149 tests/build green; PNGs render at correct dims; verified-stat gate proven both ways; eval route 401 for anon). Delivered:
- `src/app/players/[id]/card/route.tsx` — player card PNG (edge, `no-store`), `?format=post|story` → 1080×1080 / 1080×1920, verified-stat gating re-derived server-side (never trusts client toggle params).
- `src/components/share/ImageShareButtons.tsx` (client) — pre-fetches the PNG blob (debounced) so `navigator.share({files})` fires inside the click gesture (iOS rule); `canShare({files})` feature-detect → Share Image on mobile, Download on desktop.
- `src/app/players/[id]/ShareCardModal.tsx` — Post/Story toggle + ImageShareButtons at top of actions; removed the old "screenshot this card" note.
- `src/app/api/eval/card/route.tsx` — auth-gated archetype card PNG (**Node** runtime, cookie `auth.getUser()` → admin read of latest `eval_responses` + `eval_reference`), radar + archetype + top-3 + CTA.
- `src/components/eval/PerspectiveSummary.tsx` — "Share your archetype" section (covers post-submit AND `/evaluate/results`) + copy-quiz-link.
- **Gotcha learned:** satori (next/og `ImageResponse`) throws on `<svg><text>` — radar axis labels are absolutely-positioned HTML `<div>` overlays, not `<text>`. The on-page `RadarChart.tsx` still uses `<text>` (fine in the real DOM).
- **OWNER (Ambra real-phone) test still open:** profile → Share Card → Post to Instagram → share sheet shows IG Post + Story; story fills 9:16; eval summary → Share your archetype → same.

**Prior shipped (2026-07-11, `feb840a` on main): Ambra feedback round 3** — `/evaluate/results` page (saved eval results retrievable), claim-route ISR revalidation, "✓ Claimed" badge, live events-DB corrections (World Champs → Aug 13–16 Düsseldorf/worldflag26.com; bogus Women's WC 2026 unpublished; dead efaf.eu/adriabowl.com links fixed).

**Prior shipped: Phase 2 — Trust, Data Quality & Legal Hardening** (`docs/plans/2026-07-10-phase-2-trust-data-and-legal.md`, shipped 2026-07-11, merged to `main` at `d51c9b3`, live on talkinflag.com). Delivered: blog CTAs no longer imply interviews, profiles hide unset stats (no grey blocks), claimed players self-edit highlights/tournaments/key stats (verification resets on stat change), roster/coach accuracy sweep (Italy W coach → Jonathan Homer), varied eval answer anchors, LinkedIn/Web-Share fixes, and — biggest — `/privacy` + `/terms` pages, footer/sitemap links, and a data-source/removal notice on unclaimed profiles (GDPR Art. 14). See also the legal risk review `docs/legal-risk-review-2026-07-10.md`.

**Older master plan (Phases A–F all shipped weeks ago):**
`docs/plans/2026-06-06-community-rankings-platform.md` — the Community Rankings Platform. Retained as historical reference; do NOT treat its "execute Phase A" instruction as live.

**To start the next build session, say:**
> "Read CLAUDE.md and the newest plan under docs/plans/; check its task list against `git log --oneline` before executing anything."

## Open Items — Next Session

> ✅ **RLS client sweep + admin gating (2026-07-03/04, branch `rls-sweep`):** all cookie-client
> access to zero-policy (service-only) tables eliminated, and the admin-authz holes it was masking
> closed. Enforced by `src/lib/supabase/usage-guard.test.ts` and `src/lib/admin-gating.test.ts` — if
> you add a table or an admin surface, those tests tell you the rules. **Cookie client
> (`@/lib/supabase/server`) = `auth.getUser()` + policy-backed tables ONLY; every service-only table
> uses a service-role client (`createAdminClient`). Every `/admin` + `/api/admin` surface must gate via
> `getAdminUser`/`isAdminEmail` (or `CRON_SECRET`) — middleware does NOT protect them.** See
> `docs/plans/2026-07-03-rls-client-sweep-and-launch-hardening.md` + the dated follow-up note at the
> bottom of `docs/plans/2026-06-23-security-hardening.md`. Owner actions before stress test: Upstash env
> vars (shared rate limiting), leaked-password toggle, confirm `ADMIN_EMAILS`, `CRON_SECRET` + `RESEND_API_KEY`.
>
> ✅ **2026-07-05 — `ADMIN_EMAILS` (Ambra + Tika added), `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CONTACT_EMAIL_TO`, `CRON_SECRET`
> all set in Vercel** (talkinflag.com domain verified in Ambra's own Resend account), production redeployed.
> ⚠️ **Leaked-password protection is NOT enabled** — the toggle lives in Supabase → Auth → Sign In/Providers →
> Email → "Prevent use of leaked passwords" (checks new passwords against HaveIBeenPwned via the Pwned
> Passwords API), but it's **gated to the Supabase Pro plan ($25/mo)** — the project is on Free, so the
> toggle silently doesn't persist on save. Owner decision 2026-07-05: **defer** (auth here is
> magic-link/Google OAuth first, so password-based attacks are lower-risk than on a password-primary app).
> Revisit if/when the project is upgraded to Pro for other reasons — flip it then, low effort.
>
> ✅ **2026-07-05 (same session) — Upstash rate limiting wired up.** Created a free-tier Upstash Redis
> database (`talkinflag-rate-limit`, N. Virginia/us-east-1, $0/mo, 10GB monthly bandwidth cap). Set
> `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` in Vercel (Production + Preview), production
> redeployed. `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` auto-upgrades from in-memory-per-instance to shared Upstash-backed
> limiting the moment those two env vars exist — no code change was needed. **All 4 of the original
> pre-stress-test owner-action items are now closed:** ADMIN_EMAILS, RESEND_API_KEY+CONTACT_EMAIL_TO,
> CRON_SECRET, Upstash. Only the (deferred, Pro-gated) leaked-password toggle remains open by owner choice.
> **Not yet done:** a real authenticated click-through as Ambra/Tika to confirm admin access + host poll
> weight, and that an approval action actually sends an email from `noreply@talkinflag.com`.

> 🔒 **Security hardening plan (P1–P3 SHIPPED `ecec0b9`/`69023e1`/`dfad2ce`):** `docs/plans/2026-06-23-security-hardening.md`
> — rate limiting on public POST routes, newsletter/contact validation + honeypot, input caps done.
> The 2026-06-23 XSS/redirect/injection/admin fixes + DB hardening also shipped (`a878780`). Site
> launched on talkinflag.com. Remaining owner toggles: leaked-password protection, `vector` extension
> (accepted WARN). Resend (welcome email) deferred to Ambra's to-do list.

### 🚨 Owner Actions — Needed Now
See `docs/ambra-update-2026-06-25.md` (content rewritten 2026-07-05, filename kept for the existing CLAUDE.md link) for the current, authoritative owner to-do list. As of 2026-07-05, `CRON_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `ADMIN_EMAILS` (Ambra + Tika added), and Upstash rate-limiting env vars are all done. Remaining real owner actions:

**Legal (from the 2026-07-10 legal risk review — do before monetizing):**
- **Form the US entity (LLC) BEFORE any Stripe/merch/paid feature.** Taking payments as an unformed venture puts personal liability on the founders. Order is: entity → Stripe → merch. Hold this line.
- **Get the Talkin Balls / Neil "Network" partnership in writing** (revenue/IP split + naming license) before the nav "Network" rename ships.
- **Have a real attorney skim `/privacy` + `/terms`** now that they're live — especially the GDPR legitimate-interest basis and the scraped-athlete disclosure. (These pages are Claude-drafted, not attorney-reviewed.)

**Phase 2 open owner questions (data confirmations, surfaced 2026-07-11):**
- Ambra: confirm `caps=24` and `world_appearances=2` (her old profile text said 34 caps — corrected to match `caps`, single source of truth).
- Confirm **Jonathan Homer** as current Italy women's HC (spelling + still current) — set live in `coaches` + `world-rankings.ts`.
- **Real-phone share test** of the LinkedIn share + native share-sheet + OG card (can't be tested from a server).

**Config / content (unchanged from before):**
1. **Spotify Show ID** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_SHOW_ID` = `033GcDrvvxwkeS2MeKslvf`) — **corrected 2026-07-11 from the owner's Spotify dashboard screenshot.** The previously-recorded `033GcNgIw5FPNMr69P5sDU` was a transcription error (same `033Gc` prefix, wrong tail). Note: a brand-new show with no published episode is NOT publicly listed on open.spotify.com yet, so BOTH IDs 404 on the public site right now — that's expected, not proof of a bad ID. Env var stays unset until the first episode is published (then set it to `033GcDrvvxwkeS2MeKslvf`; the `/podcast` player auto-activates).
2. **5 YouTube video IDs** — `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`/`YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID` are already live in Vercel; only the 5 `TODO_OWNER` placeholders in `static-posts.ts` (Sowers/Clark-Robinson/Krouch/Doucette/Flores interviews) remain.
3. **`PRINTFUL_API_KEY` + `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`** — both exist in local `.env.local` but neither is set in **Vercel production**. Stripe is additionally **blocked on US business formation** (see legal, above) — do NOT take payments before the entity exists.
4. **Amazon Associates tag** — swap placeholder `talkinflag-20` in `static-posts.ts` once approved (add the FTC affiliate disclosure when unpaused).

> ✅ Done / dropped: host photos (none needed), DB backup tables (already gone), partner URLs (confirmed), CRON_SECRET, RESEND_API_KEY, ADMIN_EMAILS, Upstash. Password protection + login CAPTCHA: deferred. Leaked-password toggle: deferred (Supabase Pro-gated, see above). **Phase 2 (trust/data/legal) SHIPPED 2026-07-11** — see Active Roadmap.

### Build Queue
1. **TF Rankings Algorithm** — needs Ambra & Tika to define the 100-pt rubric weights.
2. **More images for Gallery** — drop in `public/gallery/`, add to array in `src/app/media/page.tsx`
3. **Profile claim outreach** — email flow for the 284 flagsonly-imported athletes to claim their profiles. `RESEND_API_KEY` is now live, so this is unblocked whenever it's prioritized.
4. **Interview articles — Q&A upgrade** — the 5 interview posts in `static-posts.ts` are currently editorial paraphrase (no quotes). Once episode transcripts are available, upgrade them to direct Q&A / pull-quotes. **Do NOT invent quotes** — quotes must come from real transcripts.
